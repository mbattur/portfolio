            <h1 class="head">Love...</h1><span class="blink"></span>
            <p><span class="line line1">...Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black.</span><br/>
            <span class="line line2">She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil,
            but her face was uncovered.</span><br/> 
            <span class="line line3">The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.</span><br/> <br/>
            
            <span class="line line4">At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul 
            of the World surged within him.</span> 
            <span class="line line5">When he looked into her dark eyes and saw
            that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence,</span> 
            <span class="line line23">he learned that most
            important part of the language that all the world spoke - the language that 
            everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart.</span><br/><br/>
            
            <span class="line line6">It was love.</span><br/> <br/>
            
            <span class="line line7">Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert.</span> <span class="line line8">Something
            that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at
            the well.</span> <span class="line line9">She smiled, and that was certainly an omen - the omen he had been
            awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life.</span> <span class="line line10">The omen he had sought to 
            find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.</span><br/> <br/>
            
            <span class="line line11">It was the pure Language of the World.</span> <span class="line line12">It required no explanation, just as
            the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.</span><br/> <br/>
            
            <span class="line line13">What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of
            the only women in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized
            the same thing.</span><br/> <span class="line line14">He was more certain of it than of anything in the world.</span><br/> <br/>
            
            <span class="line line15">He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love 
            and really know a person before becoming committed.</span> <span class="line line16">But maybe people who felt 
            that way had never learned the universal language.</span> <span class="line line17">Because, when you know that
            language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether
            it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city.</span> <span class="line line18">And when two such people
            encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become
            unimportant.</span><br/> <br/>
            
            <span class="line line19">There is only that moment and the incredible certainty that everything under the
            sun has been written by one hand only.</span> <span class="line line20">It is the hand that evokes love
            and creates a twin soul for every person in the world.</span><br/> <span class="line line21">Without such love, 
            one's dreams would have no meaning.</span><br/> <br/>
